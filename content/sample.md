I wanted to make sure that the headings that I put in my articles are the correct syntax. I'll put this project up on my blog so that others can find it as well.

# First Heading

This is text found underneath the first heading. This might as well be lorem ipsom but I wanted to work on my typing.


## Second Heading
Some more text here. Remember, the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog!

### Third Heading
Finer point. I don't know how many poeple go this far. Everything in this world is magic, except to the magician.

#### Forth 
I'm all the way down now. I can see the bottom.
